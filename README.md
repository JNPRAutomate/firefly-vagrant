# firefly-vagrant

For now, this repository will contain examples of Vagrantfiles that you can use to build virtual networks.  Once we've helped add more Junos and NETCONF capability to Vagrant, we may also include a Vagranfile generator (or integrate existing tools and webapps).


## Issues / Contributing
If you have any issues with these Vagrantfiles, please open up an issue here.  If you'd like to see a specific configuration for any Vagrant platform, or have other feature requests, this would be the place as well.
